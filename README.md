# GraphQL Subscription Example

This is a demo to demonstrate [GraphQL Subscriptions](https://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/). The backend is build using Golang while the frontend is build using Flutter.

## Backend

To run the backend, you can use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), simply run `docker-compose up -d --build` at the root directory.

## Frontend

To run the frontend, change directory to the `flutter_app` directory, and run `flutter run`. Make sure you have flutter [installed](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

A follow up post is coming soon.
